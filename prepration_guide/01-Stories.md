# Guidelines for writing stories

1. Recent job stories matter. Lookback period can be 6-7 years.
2. Minimum 20 unique stories are needed spread across all behavioural domains --> https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/behavioral/overview/introduction
3. Key insights from recruiters is:
   - The story needs to be relavant and bar-rising (over an above normal job needs)
   - At senior position: Reflection on the story and improving / learning from it is a must and needs to be said in the interview
   - Every company has different leadership principles. Do not initially chase / tune for those. Write fundamental ones first and then map story to leadership principles / frame differently.
   - You will not know which leadership principle they are testing for a particular question. Prepare answer to the questions and let them figure out the mapping. Do not guess the principle and try to answer.

4. You will definitely need more than 20 stories. Best is to look back and write down everything you did in past 6-7 years and the question can be answered by picking from that pool. 
5. Most questions that are being asked is covered in hellointerview.com, it is a good starting point
6. Chatgpt can help you write the stories and format it. Just upload two things: Resume and a rough text file of past history, ask it something like "Use my resume and past history to come up with common behavioural question answers in STAR format. Let me know if there are gaps and I will provide further stories for those"
7. The key here is to be familiar and comfortable with past work so that the answer comes naturally.
