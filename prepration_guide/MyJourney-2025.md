# My process and planning 

1. Make one resume - Ask for feedback and incorporate them into resume. 
2. Mix & Match resumes: with X% of management Y% SRE and Z% development / IC
3. Star stories and interview preprations went in parallel with applying stages below
4. My stages of Applying which I was mentally prepared for with cutoff dates for trying each:
   - Companies that I know are good / familiar with. Referrals in those companies / direct application.
   - Companies that are simply showing up in job portals. Above / at my current pay.
   - Companies that are showing up in job portals below my current pay. (<-- I got interviews here & offer - though the offer was higher than my salary, the HR people use the formula (current_salary) + 30% < what job portal salary shows)
   - NGO / Schools
   - Start a small new venture / business with Swiggy / Zepto delivery on the side 

## Planning and keeping track

I used trello boards to keep track of the following stages:

- Jobs applied (This cannot be entered and tracked so i ignored this one)
- Callback / Interest received: Started tracking in trello from here, for follow ups etc.
- Inital rounds / Screening: Move the ones from interest to here when it happens
- Loop rounds
- Reject / Closed: Move companies into this bucket whenever you feel like no response or clear reject response.
