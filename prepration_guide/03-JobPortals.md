# Guidelines for Job portals

## Naukri

1. Setting the right category and job roles in settings matter
2. Current salary setting matters for recruiter to call
3. Daily interacting with the portal matters too
4. Decent response for applications


## LinkedIn

1. You must rewrite your final-ish resume to linkedin format.
2. DO NOT copy paste resume to linkedIn. The sentence formation for resume and linkedin are different.
3. Use ChatGPT --> upload resume and ask it specifically to write content for linkedin in a leadership / fancy format and paste that there. It helps to attract recruiters
4. Put open to work. That helps mildly.
5. Premium is needed to contact recruiters directly. Many dont respond so..

## Company portals

1. This is process driven, so you will hear back one way or other
2. Will be slow
3. The jobs maybe internal / stale
4. Expect a lot of rejection emails
5. Still is worthwhile to apply because the resume gets into their system and any fresh opening they will consider your resume and call if it matches
