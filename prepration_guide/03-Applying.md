# Guidelines for applying

1. Speed of application is important. Apply atleast 20 jobs a day.
2. Exact match to JD is not needed while applying. Just generate enough signals. Many will not go through, use that to refine the resume
3. Company job portals work. But slow.
4. Referrals works if the referring person is in the same team or has enough influence to create positions or persuade the hiring manager to take interview. Asking someone working in a company to refer in the internal job portal does not work that well (atleast for me it did not)
5. LinkedIn is useless to apply for jobs. Extremly useful for recruiters to contact you.
