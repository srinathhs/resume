# Process Recommendation for future applications

## Phase 1

1. Signup for trello (or any other kanban / task management app)
2. Use one trello board for timelines and another to track applications
3. Make initial resume first with good feedbacks.
4. Start applying everywhere all at once (LinkedIn, Naukri, Referrals etc etc)

## Phase 2

1. Measure the success rate of your resume clearing the ATS system for each job category you are applying for.
2. Take few sample cases where it clears the ATS and few cases where it does not clear the ATS
3. Use the sample JD's to refine and create separate resumes for individual streams (max 2 or 3)
4. Apply - Measure - Refine - Repeat

Notes:

Phase 2 seems like phase 1 but the distinction is you need measurement for your individual resume against the ATS.
Blindly creating separate resumes for each job description does not work. In most cases the recruiter will cache your resume
and if it was a bad resume or very focused resume for that job they will not be able to match you for other jobs internally in their systems

## Phase 3

1. Start preparing for interview the moment few interests / callback show up and tone down the resume application velocity. This might take a few weeks from start of phase 1/2.
2. Key is to take time to lookback and writing all behavioural stories in STAR format.
3. Systems design is important measure for engg roles at all levels. Use hellointerview.com it is a excellent quality website for this purpose. All other youtube videos are useless against this. It is worthwhile to pay 55$ for the subscription, it unlocks community and you get to see all recent system design questions asked by many top companies for different levels. Very usefull.
4. Do the interviews and get job offers
