# Managing the panic

NOTE: These below are my observations and what worked for me. It may not be universally applicable.

* Self confidence and a stable emotional mind is key.
* It is no longer about "correct" answers alone. The process has become very subjective (to the company values) - behavioural rounds
* Managing mental load needs a process. You cannot work, write resume, apply for jobs and prepare for interviews at the same time. it will not be effecient without it, nor there will be any clarity. Use trello. (SEE: MyJourney-2025.md)
* Friends / collegues and mock interviews really helped me.
* Panic is inevetible but looking backwards it feels unwarranted (people tend to come from this standpoint when they try to soothe / support). 
* Forward looking panic can only be resolved with acceptance of reality and coming up with a roadmap (include financial assessment and cutoff dates).
